        <h1>Starting a Game</h1>
        <p>To start a game of Whack-A-Pede, just tap the play button located in the top right corner of the screen next to the menu.  When you do, it should turn into a paused button.  At the same time, you should see a centipede crawling onto the lawn, and the countdown timer should start counting down.  You might also hear background music playing unless your volume is turned down all the way.</p>

        <a name="basic_gameplay"></a>
        <h1>Basic Gameplay</h1>
        <p>Once the game is started, just tap on the centipede when it's above ground to clear its segments from the lawn for points.  It will turn at random and dive down into and back up out of holes in the lawn.  You can't attack segments that are underground.  Notice that when you tap on the centipede's segments, it splits and even scatters if you whack it on its head!</p>

        <a name="pausing_a_game"></a>
        <h1>Pausing a Game</h1>
        <p>To pause a game that going, just tap the pause button located int the top right corner of the screen next tot he menu.  It should be right where the play button was before.  The game will also automatically pause if you tap on the menu, rotate your phone, or go to another app while Whack-A-Pede is running.</p>

        <a name="quitting_a_game"></a>
        <h1>Quitting a Game</h1>
        <p>To quit a game that is going, first tap the menu in the top right corner of the screen.  Then, tap on Quit Game.  Whack-A-Pede will ask you to make sure you really want to quit.  Tap on Yes Quit if you're really sure.</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/quit_menu.png" />
        <br />
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/select_quit.png" />

        <a name="basic_scoring"></a>
        <h1>Basic Scoring</h1>
        <p>Every segment you clear is worth 100 points, and you also get 10 more seconds on the countdown timer.  If you clear all the segments before the timer runs out, a new round begins with a faster centipede, but if the timer reaches zero, it's game over!  Any time left on the clock at the end of a round gets converted to 10 bonus points per second remaining.</p>

        <a name="changing_settings"></a>
        <h1>Changing Settings</h1>
        <p>To change the game's settings, first tap on the menu in the top right corner of the screen to open it.  Then, tap on Change Settings in the menu.  You will arrive at the settings screen.</p>

        <br />
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/select_settings.png" />
        <p>You can change the music and sound effects volume independently by tapping and dragging the thumb on the sliders to the desired volume level.  Zero volume mutes it, and 100% maxes that volume.  You can also change the music track that plays in the background by tapping on Music Track and then choosing one from the list.  Tapping on Color Theme and choosing one from the list is how you change the colors of the Whack-A-Pede lawn and centipede, too, and a preview lets you see how it will look.</p>

        <a name="signing_in"></a>
        <h1>Signing In</h1>
        <p>Whack-A-Pede defaults to guest play so you can just start playing right away, but guest play doesn't save your high scores and you can't unlock achievements or get on the leaderboard as a guest either.  To sign in, first tap on the menu in the top right corner of the screen, and then tap on Sign In with Google.</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/sign_in_menu.png" />
        <br />
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/select_sign_in.png" />
        <p>Whack-A-Pede will connect to Google Play Games and then prompt you for the account you want to sign in with.  You can either choose from the available accounts, or you can create a new one if you like.  Once you select from the available accounts, you will be signed in, and the scoreboard will display your Play Games avatar and screen name.</p>

        <a name="signing_out"></a>
        <h1>Signing Out</h1>
        <p>Once you are signed in, you can also sign out.  To do so, fist tap on the menu in the top right corner of the screen.  Then tap on Sign Out.  You'll be signed out and back to playing as a guest.</p>

        <a name="viewing_leaderboard"></a>
        <h1>Viewing the Leaderboard</h1>
        <p>While signed in, games you play can earn you standing on the leaderboard, and you can also unlock achievements.  To view the leaderboard, first tap on the menu in the top right hand corner of the screen, then tap on View Leaderboard.  You will arrive at the leaderboard screen.</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/view_leaders_menu.png" />
        <br />
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/select_view_leaders.png" />
        <p>From top to bottom, the leaderboard screen shows your leaderboard entry, any achievements you unlocked, and the leaderboard entries for top 25 players, excluding you.  Placeholders may appear while the content downloads from the Internet or if it couldn't be downloaded for some reason, including the fact that it may not exist yet.  You get on the leaderboard by playing and finishing a game while signed in.</p>
        <img class="screenshot" src="file:///android_asset/images/leaderboard.png" />
        <p>The leaderboard screen has its own menu that lets you view the leaderboard and available achievements in Google Play Games.  Google Play Games itself offers a richer leaderboard and achievement experience than the Whack-A-Pede leaderboard.  Not only can you view Whack-A-Pede's leaderboard and achievements, but you can also explore those of other games, too!</p>

        <a name="power_ups"></a>
        <h1>Power Ups</h1>
        <p>As you play Whack-A-Pede, about once every minute, various power ups will traverse across the lawn.  In this example, a 1,000-point Bonus power up is on the lawn.  Power ups will roam around the lawn and turn randomly just the centipedes do, but they never go underground.  To activate a power up, simply tap it.  Power ups currently offer a few basic advantages in the game.  You can earn lots of extra points or even reset the centipede's speed all the way to its slowest starting speed.  More and better power ups will be introduced in later releases of Whack-A-Pede.</p>
