## Summary

Whack-A-Pede is a modern arcade game for Android phones and tablets.

## Installation Instructions

### During Testing

- To run on an appropriate Android Studio phone or tablet emulator, open the project with Android Studio, select the desired emulator from the dropdown, and then click run.

- To run on a compatible hardware Android phone or tablet, make the provided APK file accessible to your device, open it on your device, and follow the on screen prompts.  You may need to change your phone's settings to allow the Package Installer to open APKs for this to work.

### After Release

- From a compatible hardware Android phone or tablet, open the Google Play Store, search for Whack-A-Pede, and follow the Google Play Store prompts to install it.

## Hardware Requirements

- Android phones and tablets running Android 6.0 (API 23) or later are required.

- A physical device meeting those requirements is recommended for testing, but an emulator should be fine for testing most, if not all features.

- Whether on a physical device or emulator, the most recent version of Google Play Services and Google Play Games should be installed for sign-in and leaderboard functionality to work.

### Hardware and Emulators Tested On

- Tested on Nexus 5 Emulators, Android 6.0 through 10.0 (API 23 through 29), with caveats below.

- Tested on Nexus 9 and Pixel C Emulator, Android 7.0 (API 27), with caveats below.

- Tested on Pixel 3 Hardware, Android 10.0 (API 29).

- The following emulators do not have an SDK with Google Play Store functionality available.  Google Play Games sign in, achievements, and leaderboard functionality cannot be tested on these emulators, though other functionality can:

    - Pixel C or Nexus 9, Any Level.
    - No Tablet Emulators have Google Play Store functionality.
